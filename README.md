# mad_tolerator
Small program written with Lazarus for mechanical adjustments according to ISO norm.
Just enter the nominal dimension, the tolerance, either for bore or shaft, and you get the maximal and minimal IT, as well as the minimal and maximal dimensions.
For the moment, the software is only in french language. Multiple languages will be added ASAP, as well as the possibility of copying the results in the clipboard.
